 Counting Triangles
 
 Given a list of N triangles with integer side lengths, determine how many different triangles there are. Two triangles are considered to be the same if they can both be placed on the plane such that their vertices occupy exactly the same three points.
 Signature
 int countDistinctTriangles(ArrayList<Sides> arr)
 or
 int countDistinctTrianges(int[][] arr)
 Input
 
 In some languages, arr is an Nx3 array where arr[i] is a length-3 array that contains the side lengths of the ith triangle. In other languages, arr is a list of structs/objects that each represent a single triangle with side lengths a, b, and c.
 It's guaranteed that all triplets of side lengths represent real triangles.
 All side lengths are in the range [1, 1,000,000,000]
 
 1 <= N <= 1,000,000
 
 Output
 Return the number of distinct triangles in the list.
 
 Example 1
 arr = [[2, 2, 3], [3, 2, 2], [2, 5, 6]]
 output = 2
 The first two triangles are the same, so there are only 2 distinct triangles.
 
 Example 2
 arr = [[8, 4, 6], [100, 101, 102], [84, 93, 173]]
 output = 3
 All of these triangles are distinct.
 
 Example 3
 arr = [[5, 8, 9], [5, 9, 8], [9, 5, 8], [9, 8, 5], [8, 9, 5], [8, 5, 9]]
 output = 1
 
 All of these triangles are the same.
