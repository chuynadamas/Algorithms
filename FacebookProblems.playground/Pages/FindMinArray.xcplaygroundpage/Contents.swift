 Element Swapping
 Given a sequence of n integers arr, determine the lexicographically smallest sequence which may be obtained from it after performing at most k element swaps, each involving a pair of consecutive elements in the sequence.
 Note: A list x is lexicographically smaller than a different equal-length list y if and only if, for the earliest index at which the two lists differ, x's element at that index is smaller than y's element at that index.
 Signature
 int[] findMinArray(int[] arr, int k)
 
 Input
 n is in the range [1, 1000].
 Each element of arr is in the range [1, 1,000,000].
 k is in the range [1, 1000].
 
 Output
 Return an array of n integers output, the lexicographically smallest sequence achievable after at most k swaps.
 
 Example 1
 n = 3
 k = 2
 arr = [5, 3, 1]
 output = [1, 5, 3]
 We can swap the 2nd and 3rd elements, followed by the 1st and 2nd elements, to end up with the sequence [1, 5, 3]. This is the lexicographically smallest sequence achievable after at most 2 swaps.
 
 Example 2
 n = 5
 k = 3
 arr = [8, 9, 11, 2, 1]
 output = [2, 8, 9, 11, 1]
 We can swap [11, 2], followed by [9, 2], then [8, 2].
